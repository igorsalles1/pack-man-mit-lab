# pack-man-mit-lab
##Â·	Description
This is a Pack-man animation where four pictures are linked objects, then iterated to simulate mouth movement. The movement continues within the screen boundaries. When it reaches the Boundary it reverses course.
### Future Improvements
*add background with maze boundaries
*Have Pack-Man follow commands
*Add content for Pack-Man to consume
